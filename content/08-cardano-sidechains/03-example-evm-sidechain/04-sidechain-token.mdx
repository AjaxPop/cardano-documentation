## What is SC_Token?

**SC_Token<sup>1</sup>** is the native token of Cardano sidechains launched through a Cardano EVM sidechain client. SC_Token can be moved between the main chain (Cardano) and the example EVM sidechain, and SC_Token is required to pay for gas.

## What is test SC_Token and how can I claim it via a faucet?

**Test SC_Token**, or 'Sidechain Testnet Tokens' SC_Token, is the native token of the example EVM sidechain testnet. Test SC_Token carries no real-world value.

IO Global maintains a faucet at <PENDING_URL> for testing purposes. The faucet dispenses test SC_Token that you can use to pay the gas fees on smart contracts that you run on the Atago testnet. You can claim one test SC_Token every 24 hours. You cannot swap the test SC_Token tokens you claim from the faucet for any other token, nor can you use them to make any purchases.  

## What is gas?

**Gas** refers to the computational cost necessary to successfully conduct a transaction on the sidechain network. This gas is detonated from a small fraction of SC_Token when conducting a transaction, deploying a smart contract, or writing to a smart contract.
